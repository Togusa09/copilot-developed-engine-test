# HumanDeveloperTests

This project is reserved for manually authored tests by human developers.

- Keep experimental, spike, or workflow-specific tests here.
- This scaffold currently builds a placeholder executable named `HumanDeveloperTests`.
- Add new source files under `src/` and wire them in `CMakeLists.txt` as needed.
