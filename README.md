# EngineTest

Minimal C++ scaffold for a 3D game engine project with FBX loading and selectable modern rendering backends.

## Project Layout

- `src/Engine`: Static library for engine code
- `src/Sandbox`: Executable used to test engine features
- `tests`: Unit and integration test targets plus developer-owned test scaffold

## Current Features

- FBX model loading via `Assimp`
- Renderer backends for `DirectX 12` and `Vulkan` (through SDL3 renderer driver selection)
- GUI controls via `Dear ImGui`
- Native file picker integration via `nativefiledialog-extended`
- Interactive model rotation and camera distance controls

## Requirements

- CMake 3.26+
- A C++20 compiler
  - Visual Studio 2026 (MSVC) on Windows
  - Clang or GCC on Linux/macOS
- Internet access during first configure/build (dependencies are pulled with CMake `FetchContent`)

### Windows setup (winget)

Install the required tools on Windows with:

```powershell
winget install --id Kitware.CMake -e
winget install --id Ninja-build.Ninja -e
```

Optional: install Visual Studio Community (IDE + MSVC toolchain) instead of Build Tools:

```powershell
winget install --id Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.Community -e
```

### Verify installs (Windows)

Open a new terminal after installation, then run:

```powershell
cmake --version
ninja --version
where.exe cl
```

If `cl` is not found, open the **x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2026** and run the same checks there.

## Build (Windows, Visual Studio)

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build-vs -G "Visual Studio 18 2026" -A x64
cmake --build build-vs --config Debug
.\build-vs\src\Sandbox\Debug\Sandbox.exe
```

Run these commands from **Developer PowerShell for VS 2026** (or after the MSVC toolchain is available in your PATH).

## Runtime Usage

1. Start `Sandbox`.
2. Click **Load FBX** in the **Model Viewer** window.
3. Select an `.fbx` file.
4. Rotate the model with:
  - left-mouse drag in empty viewport area, or
  - Yaw/Pitch/Roll sliders.
5. Adjust camera distance with the slider.

If DirectX 12 renderer creation fails on the machine, the app automatically falls back to Vulkan, then software rendering.

For troubleshooting backend-specific rendering issues, set `ENGINE_RENDERER` before launch to force a backend:

```powershell
$env:ENGINE_RENDERER = "software"   # or "dx12", "vulkan"
.\build-vs\src\Sandbox\Debug\Sandbox.exe
```

To opt into the experimental native DirectX 12 + `imgui_impl_dx12` path:

```powershell
$env:ENGINE_NATIVE_DX12 = "1"
$env:ENGINE_RENDERER = "dx12"
.\build-vs\src\Sandbox\Debug\Sandbox.exe
```

Current scope of the native DX12 path: frame clear + Dear ImGui UI rendering. Model wireframe rendering is still handled in the SDL renderer path.

If renderer fallback recreates ImGui at runtime, treat the current frame draw data as invalid.
Do not call the SDL renderer backend with draw data captured before context teardown; skip that frame and continue with a fresh `ImGui::NewFrame()` cycle.

## Build (Ninja)

On Windows with MSVC, run this from **Developer PowerShell for VS 2026** so the compiler environment is initialized.

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build-ninja -G Ninja
cmake --build build-ninja
.\build-ninja\src\Sandbox\Sandbox.exe
```

## Run Tests

CTest targets are enabled by default when `ENGINE_BUILD_TESTS=ON`.

Visual Studio generator:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build-vs -G "Visual Studio 18 2026" -A x64
cmake --build build-vs --config Debug
ctest --test-dir build-vs -C Debug --output-on-failure
```

Ninja generator:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build-ninja -G Ninja
cmake --build build-ninja
ctest --test-dir build-ninja --output-on-failure
```

Included test targets:

- `EngineUnitTests`: unit checks for core data model behavior
- `EngineIntegrationTests`: integration checks for FBX loading against repository assets
- `HumanDeveloperTests`: scaffold project reserved for manually authored developer tests

## Next Steps

1. Add a platform layer (window/input abstraction)
2. Add renderer module (OpenGL/Vulkan/DirectX)
3. Add ECS, asset pipeline, and scene system
4. Evaluate a native DirectX 12 renderer path with `imgui_impl_dx12` (instead of SDL renderer backend) for deeper DX12 diagnostics and backend-specific stability validation.
